THINGS TO GET FIXED:
	
	Entities:
		:: Create a superclass
		- Determine variables and behaviors shared by all constructable entities like cities and mines.
		- Write Entity abstract superclass which constuctable objects will extend. 
		- Rewrite existing constructable objects to extend completed Entity class.
		
	Documentation:
		:: All files must be documented with comments to increase readability: all methods must have at least one line of header describing their purpose and parameters; variables and constants should have uniform naming conventions.
		- Document Sisyphus.java
		- Document Commands.java
		- Document Frames.java
		- Document God.java
		- Document Mines.java
		- Document Cities.java
		- Document Entity.java
		- Document GlobalConstants.java
		
	Modularity:
		:: The algorithms running the game must be adjustable from a main control file. 
		- Expand GlobalConstants.java file into designated control code; it will hold all the components of gameplay algoithm-equations so that they may be adujsted easily for testing and EASY/HARD mode features. Group constants together for readability and comment. 
		- Overload Entity-inheriting classes' constructors to assign different rates of growth/decay/etc. depending on parameters passed. A lack of parameters should be taken to mean default rates.

	Optimization:
		:: Make code run quicker and more elegantly when possible.
