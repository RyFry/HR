THINGS TO GET FIXED:

	-	Make City and Mines extend the Entity class to make the code cleaner
	-	Make methods that City and Mines share (i.e. do the same thing, such as losing population) have the same name
			This should just be making the method in Entity and not over-writing it
			
	-	Add comments everywhere so that we know what the heck is going on.
